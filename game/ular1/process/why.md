# Why?

## Because... (2025-05-22)

While making SNAKISTS I had the (repeated from SNAKISMS) insight that [you could always have a version of plain Snake included in the minigames](https://pippinbarr.com/SNAKISTS/process/journal.html#:~:text=The%20same%20thing,create%20progressive%20revisions%3F) because the default game itself would reflect that positionality/those values/that vibe. In SNAKISMS it was "Conservatism" and in SNAKISTS it was "Purist".

I noted then that I could make a game where *every* minigame was "just Snake" but assigned different titles to inflect the player's interpretation or understanding of the concept/Snake itself.

And this is me making that game to explore the consequences of design. There's not much design to do, but there's the question of *which* words/titles will work and *why* and whether there's any room for different forms of expression going on in there and whether perhaps in curating the full set of titles there's a chance to say something (weird? odd? surprising?) about Snake.

In a sense it may almost amount to a kind of "value inventory" of the game, presented through the game itself.
