# Candidates

I had a file like this for SNAKISTS where I would develop a little further individual "ists" that I could imagine working. Here I want to do some similar thinking, except it will be thinking about how a given word appropriately describes/evokes/metaphorizes/call to/somethings the game of Snake. And also maybe some higher level thinking about potential categories that these might fall into, as that may help me try to make the games more "varied" in the sense of *how* the words apply.

## Criteria and qualities

A. The main thing is that an ism should be plausible/acceptable/applicable

That is, it should make *some* kind of sense that the word describes or is reflected in or affirmed by or metaphorized by the standard version of Snake. So "nudism" works because the Snake is nude and therefore could be said to represent the philosophy of preferring to be naked.

## Isms short list

* agroterrorism
* alcoholism
* arcadianism
* auteurism
* behaviorism
* cannibalism
* careerism
* copyism
* deism
* escapism
* euphemism
* fetishism
* formalism
* futilitarianism
* giantism
* hedonism
* idealism
* lyricism
* masochism
* materialism
* mechanism

## Isms long list

### abranchialism

> no gills

Truism.

kind of funny into a truism way

### academicism

> adherence to formal or conventional rules and traditions in art or literature.

Meta. Sort of describes the overall project, idea of traditional gameplay.

There are other metas like this, shouldn't have more than one unless they have genuinely different angles.

### ~~achromatism~~

> Achromatism, in general, refers to the property of being without color or lacking chromatic aberration

Truism (of the snake itself, not the apple)

Too weak.

### ~~actualism~~

> In philosophical terms, actualism is the view that the only things that truly "are" are those that are actually existing. It posits that to be is to exist, and existence is the same as being actual. Essentially, it rejects the idea of things that could have been or could be, but aren't, as having any real existence

There's a category of things that are maybe just sufficiently disconnected from Snake that, yeah it applies, but maybe not all that interesting.

Weak.

### Adamitism

> Adamitism, in religious contexts, refers to a Christian sect that practiced nudism as part of their worship. It was believed that returning to the state of innocence of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden meant returning to a state of heavenly perfection, which they saw as requiring no clothing. 

Implication.

The new Nudism, but religious. There are categories that can *imply* things about the snake or itself world that you wouldn't normally think was there. A kind of editorializing or fictionalizing or revelation.

### * agnosticism (aka. religion in general)

> a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God.

 Implication.
 
 The idea that the snake is an agnostic (or religious or aetheist etc.) Maybe this could be use to compare two versions of Snake aligned with different religion. A suggestion of two different snakes and asking the question of whether it makes a different what the snake believes in.
 
 See also:
 - deism
 - monotheism
 etc.
 
 ### * agritourism
 
 > Agritourism is a form of tourism that involves visiting a working farm or agricultural operation for educational, recreational, or entertainment purposes. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including farm visits, educational tours, festivals, and farm-to-table experiences. Agritourism helps to connect the public with agriculture, promotes rural tourism, and provides supplemental income for farmers. 

Re-metaphorizing.

Snake as Apple Picking simulator. The idea that you could recast what the snake is ACTUALLY DOING is quite interesting.

### * agroterrorism

> Agroterrorism is a form of bioterrorism specifically targeting agricultural systems, including crops and livestock, with the aim of disrupting a society's food supply and economy. It involves the deliberate introduction of harmful agents like viruses, bacteria, or toxins to cause illness or death in animals or damage to crops, often with the goal of instilling fear or coercing governments or populations. 

Re-metaphorizing.

Kind of a fun recasting. Eating all the apples.

### * ahistoricism

> Ahistoricism refers to the tendency to disregard or ignore historical context, tradition, and the way past events and developments continue to shape current societies. It's a lack of concern for history, as if it has no relevance or bearing on present-day issues. 

Critique.

Nice to think of a version that's about being critical (fairly or unfairly) of how snake works as a game. In this case the idea that it's so closed off from any social context.

### alcoholism

Re-metaphorizing.

Snake as alcoholic. This makes me think of abstractions like The Marriage and so on. As with apple picking I guess. Some of these could get more outlanding, Snake as an appropriate METAPHOR for something.

---

At this point: having that same old recognition that the energy requirements of going *all* the way through the 2.3k entries are not very realistic or, maybe even interesting. It's like reading the dictionary. There are only certain people who can or should do that.

So I'm rerouting to reading it for words I a) know and b) think are interesting.

---

### * allegorism

> Allegorism is the use of allegory, a literary device where characters, objects, or events symbolize abstract ideas or moral qualities. It's a narrative method where a story or work of art has a surface meaning and a deeper, hidden meaning that is revealed through the symbolic elements. Allegorism can also refer to the belief that the primary value and significance of earthly things lies in their connection to the divine. 

Meta-meta

Suggesting that Snake is an Allegory machine? Saying it's an allegory but not what for.

### * amateurism

> the practicing of an activity, especially a sport, on an unpaid rather than a professional basis.

True. Double-true?

The idea that the Snake and Player are unpaid, but maybe also not good at what they're doing?

### animalism

> behavior that is characteristic of or appropriate to animals, particularly in being physical and instinctive.

Truism.

### antimodernism

> Antimodernism is a term that describes a resistance to or a rejection of the cultural, social, and intellectual trends associated with modernization, often characterized by a preference for older traditions, values, or ways of life. It can be seen as a reaction against the perceived negative aspects of modernization, such as the weakening of traditional values or the alienation of individuals in a rapidly changing world. 

Critique.

The idea of Snake as a critique of newer forms of gameplay.

Related to conservatism, academicism, ...

### aphorism

> a pithy observation that contains a general truth, such as, “if it ain't broke, don't fix it.”.

Re-casting?

The idea of Snake as a pithy observation about games and play?

### * arcadianism

> Arcadianism, derived from the ancient Greek region of Arcadia, refers to an idealized view of rustic or pastoral life, often characterized by simplicity, harmony with nature, and innocence. It's a concept that can be applied to both literature and life, representing a yearning for a simpler, more natural existence. 

Idealizing?

The idea of Snake as a better place?

### athleticism

> the physical qualities that are characteristic of athletes, such as strength, fitness, and agility.

Re-seeing?

The idea of perceiving the snake as athletic?

### atomism

> a theoretical approach that regards something as interpretable through analysis into distinct, separable, and independent elementary components.

Analysis?

Did I already do this one? Snake is an atomic game, tile-based?

### * auteurism

> Auteurism, a term derived from the French word "auteur" (meaning author), is a film theory that emphasizes the director as the primary creative force in a movie. It suggests that directors, not writers or other collaborators, are the true "authors" of their films, expressing their unique style and themes through their visual choices and overall approach. 

Acknowledging myself as an "auteur"? Funny. Double funny because it's then a game I didn't design and my auteurism is about asserting I somehow redesigned by applying a word to it? Har har?

### * behaviorism

> the theory that human and animal behavior can be explained in terms of conditioning, without appeal to thoughts or feelings, and that some mental conditions are best treated by altering behavior patterns.

Explaination.

An understanding of what Snake is like to play. It's like operant conditioning.

### brutalism

> a style of architecture or art characterized by a deliberate plainness, crudity, or violence of imagery. The term was first applied to functionalist buildings of the 1950s and 1960s that made much use of steel and concrete in starkly massive blocks.

Is Snake a brutalist game?

### * cannibalism

> the practice of eating the flesh of one's own species.

Re-casting. Love that this means the apples are little bits of snake meat.

### * careerism

> Careerism, often used disapprovingly, refers to the intense focus on career advancement and status, sometimes at the expense of personal values, ethics, or other aspects of life. It's the pursuit of promotions, power, and prestige within an organization, often perceived as a driving force behind individuals' behaviors and decisions. 

Recasting/judging.

Funny to think of the Snake/player as a "careerist" fixated on a single goal at the expense of living.

### classicism

> the following of ancient Greek or Roman principles and style in art and literature, generally associated with harmony, restraint, and adherence to recognized standards of form and craftsmanship, especially from the Renaissance to the 18th century.

Truism?

### conservatism

> commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.

But already done in SNAKISMS.

### * copyism

> "Copyism" refers to the act of copying, especially when done in a mechanical or unthinking way, or when it involves the slavish imitation of something without originality. In art, it can also refer to a specific artistic movement that focuses on reinterpreting existing works. 

That's true. Hehe.

### creationism

> the belief that the universe and living organisms originate from specific acts of divine creation, as in the biblical account, rather than by natural processes such as evolution.

Meta? The idea that I'm god who created this game divinely?

### * defeatism

> a person who expects or is excessively ready to accept failure.

The Player.

I like that some of these things specifically speak to the player themselves? You will die, you churl?

### dilettantism

> Dilettantism is the practice of engaging in a field of study or activity in a superficial or non-serious way, often for amusement or without deep expertise. It's about dabbling in something, having an amateur interest, rather than being deeply invested and knowledgeable. 

The Designer?

Is it fair to title a game after a quality of the designer? I think yeah...

### egotism

> the practice of talking and thinking about oneself excessively because of an undue sense of self-importance.

But also a philosophical position?

The Player. The Designer. The Snake. ?

### * epicureanism

> an ancient school of philosophy founded in Athens by Epicurus. The school rejected determinism and advocated hedonism (pleasure as the highest good), but of a restrained kind: mental pleasure was regarded more highly than physical, and the ultimate pleasure was held to be freedom from anxiety and mental pain, especially that arising from needless fear of death and of the gods.

Philosophy? Snake's position? Player's?

### eremitism

> Eremitism, or the eremitic life, refers to a state of solitude and seclusion where a person lives a life of prayer, study, and self-discipline, often as a religious hermit or recluse. It is characterized by a deliberate choice to withdraw from the social world to focus on spiritual growth and connection with God. 

Snake as hermit?

### eroticism

> the quality or character of being erotic.

By assertion?

### escapism

> the tendency to seek distraction and relief from unpleasant realities, especially by seeking entertainment or engaging in fantasy.

Well, player?

### * euphemism

> a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something unpleasant or embarrassing.

By assertion? Wouldn't want to overdo it but a couple of funny little assertions would be nice right?

### exceptionalism

> Exceptionalism is the belief that a particular entity, like a country, society, or even an individual, is unique, unusual, or extraordinary in some way, often implying superiority compared to others. It suggests that this entity deserves a different standard of evaluation or has a special role in the world. 

The snake is exceptional no?

### * fetishism

> a form of sexual behavior in which gratification is strongly linked to a particular object or activity or a part of the body other than the sexual organs.

The apple as sexual object for the snake is nice. Sexy.

### formalism

> excessive adherence to prescribed forms.

Seems fair.

### functionalism

> (in the arts) the doctrine that the design of an object should be determined solely by its function, rather than by aesthetic considerations, and that anything practically designed will be inherently beautiful.

Asserting that the snake is beautiful?

### * futilitarianism

> Futilitarianism is the belief that human striving and effort are ultimately futile or without purpose. It's a blend of the words "futile" and "utilitarian," suggesting a view that even maximizing utility or striving for benefit doesn't lead to meaningful outcomes. Essentially, futilitarianism is the idea that human endeavors are ultimately wasted or pointless. 

Well I want more people to know about this.

### * giantism

> a tendency toward abnormally large size; gigantism.

Hehe.

### * hedonism

> the pursuit of pleasure; sensual self-indulgence.

The snake is a hedonist above all?

### * idealism

> the practice of forming or pursuing ideals, especially unrealistically.

Hehe

### insularism

> Insularism, at its core, means the state of being isolated or detached. It can also refer to a narrow-mindedness or illiberality of opinion, often associated with a limited perspective and unwillingness to consider different viewpoints. 

Seems fair... quite like the more extended idea of a lack of perspective...

### laconicism

> Laconicism is the quality of being brief, concise, and using minimal words to express something. It's often associated with a style of speech or writing that is terse and to the point, as was favored by the Spartans of ancient Laconia. 

The idea of brevity here.

### * lyricism

> an artist's expression of emotion in an imaginative and beautiful way; the quality of being lyrical.

I like the idea of asserting Snake is lyrically beautiful

### Machiavellianism

> Machiavellianism, in a psychological context, is a personality trait characterized by manipulativeness, self-interest, and a tendency to see others as tools for personal gain. It is named after Niccolò Machiavelli, who argued that rulers should use whatever means necessary to maintain power. Machiavellianism is one of the traits that make up the "Dark Triad" of negative personality traits, along with narcissism and psychopathy. 

Player as Machiavellian? Designer as?

### * masochism

> the tendency to derive pleasure, especially sexual gratification, from one's own pain or humiliation.

That's funny. And even communicates with the previous game's SADIST in a weird way.

### * materialism

> a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spiritual values.

The apple the apple.

### * mechanism

> a system of parts working together in a machine; a piece of machinery.

I like this idea, Snake as a mechanism in which the player takes a position.

### middlemanism

> Middlemanism, according to {Merriam-Webster https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/middlemanism}, is a system or practice that relies on the use of middlemen, who act as intermediaries in business dealings. Essentially, it refers to the reliance on individuals or organizations that facilitate transactions between producers and consumers, earning a profit by providing services like distribution, marketing, or negotiation, {according to multiple dictionaries and online resources https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100156306, https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/middlemanism, https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/middleman.asp}. 

Intriguing description of the player-avatar relationship? Avatar as middleman?

### mimestism

> Mimesis, derived from the Ancient Greek word mimesis (μίμησις), refers to the act of imitating or mimicking, especially in the context of art and culture. It also describes the process of representing or re-presenting the world around us, as seen in literary criticism and philosophy. In a broader sense, mimesis can encompass various forms of imitation, including behaviors, appearances, and even the presentation of the self. 

copyism is similar though.

### mysticism

> belief that union with or absorption into the Deity or the absolute, or the spiritual apprehension of knowledge inaccessible to the intellect, may be attained through contemplation and self-surrender.

Would be fun to have an ending point of the "poem" of the menu?

Right now we'd end of "mechanism" which I don't hate
